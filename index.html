    <h2> you should <i>never</i> bully anyone</h2>
      <p> Before you even think about bullying someone read this this will hopefully
        change your mind. If someone in your school is different you might want to stay
         away from them because everyone says they are a freak or if you go near them you
          might get some kind of disease. Before you keep spreading that rumer then think
          twice say these things in your head: If you were that person would you like it,
          To that person i might be different. And the most important one EMPATHY.</p>

          <h2>Left Out</h2>
        <P>if you like reading then you should read left out.
        left out is a book about a guy who is deaf and people are being mean to him but he wants to start football.
        this book is such a good book i think it is touching because in the book he is getting bullied by everyone in his school
        his sister is super nice and cares for him dearly. in this book you will see how much bullying can affect people.</P>

        <h2> what saying hi can do</h2>
     <p> saying hi to someone that you see on the playground who you know people are being mean to.
            That can make their day just knowing that there don't believe me try it is AWESOME what it can do.
             becoming their friend would do more they would have a reason to go play outside and not stay
             hidden in the bathroom because they are scared. but most important is they will have someone to stick up for them 
    
    
     Someone that knows you are there. </p> 
     <h2> if you are a bully</h2>
     <p> if you are a bully hopefully this website will change your mind
          if it has not please read the book Left Out it will change your life.  </p>
